Assignment 3: Classify Mushrooms

Approach:
    - The program reads data input and normalized them double representation.
    - Data are slitted into 2 parts, training and testing.
    - Initialized weight to random double number -1 to 1.
    - Create 2 hidden layers with the first hidden layer has 7 nodes, and the 2nd layer has 3 nodes.
    - Perform ANN Back Propagation
        + Back Propagation happened when the output through the forward propagation fail to produce the desirable output.
        + Adjust weight through back propagation
    - Print all the training weights which will be use to perform a final test with the test data set.
    - Running all test data set through the ANN with the given weight and compute the percentage accuracy.
    - Output accuracy from the training and test.

Problem:
    - Initialized could be zero which produce uninteresting result, and slow down the training process.
    - Training data is picked from the top of 85% of the data set which ignore the bottom 15% with special "?"
    - For the sack of time, the training stop when the output percentage is doing worst within 5 epochs or 10000 epoch is already passed.
    - Inconsistency accuracy output between the training data set and testing data set.
